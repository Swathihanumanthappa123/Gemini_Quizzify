        Renders a file uploader in a Streamlit app, processes uploaded PDF files,
        extracts their pages, and updates the self.pages list with the total number of pages.
        
        Given:
        - Handling of temporary files with unique names to avoid conflicts.
        
        Your Steps:
        1. Utilize the Streamlit file uploader widget to allow users to upload PDF files.
           Hint: Look into st.file_uploader() with the 'type' parameter set to 'pdf'.
        2. For each uploaded PDF file:
           a. Generate a unique identifier and append it to the original file name before saving it temporarily.
              This avoids name conflicts and maintains traceability of the file.
           b. Use Langchain's PyPDFLoader on the path of the temporary file to extract pages.
           c. Clean up by deleting the temporary file after processing.
        3. Keep track of the total number of pages extracted from all uploaded documents.
        
        Example for generating a unique file name with the original name preserved:
        ```
        unique_id = uuid.uuid4().hex
        temp_file_name = f"{original_name}_{unique_id}{file_extension}"
        ```
